# Open FinOps

> A modular platform for managing business agreements in finance and operations

## Overview

Open FinOps is an open-source platform designed to help businesses manage their financial and operational agreements in a centralized, modular way. The platform streamlines contract management, tracking, and financial reporting across various agreement types including vendor contracts, leases, promotions, allowances, and more.

## Vision

To provide businesses with a comprehensive, flexible, and transparent solution for managing all aspects of their contractual relationships—from vendor agreements to real estate leases—while seamlessly integrating with financial systems.

## Phase 1: Vendor Contract Management

The initial phase focuses on vendor contract tracking and management, providing essential tools for:

- Centralized contract repository
- Contract lifecycle management
- Agreement terms tracking
- Financial integration and reporting

## Core Modules

### 1. Agreement Management
