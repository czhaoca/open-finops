# Open FinOps

> A modular platform for managing business agreements in finance and operations

## Overview

Open FinOps is an open-source platform designed to help businesses manage their financial and operational agreements in a centralized, modular way. The platform streamlines contract management, tracking, and financial reporting across various agreement types including vendor contracts, leases, promotions, allowances, and more.

## Vision

To provide businesses with a comprehensive, flexible, and transparent solution for managing all aspects of their contractual relationshipsâ€”from vendor agreements to real estate leasesâ€”while seamlessly integrating with financial systems.

- Centralized contract repository
